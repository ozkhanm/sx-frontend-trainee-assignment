They sometimes release iPhone, Galaxy or Pixel reviews weeks or even months after launch. Just look at Youtube, and impact on views from being first with a review. Reviews that arrive weeks after a product launch don&#x27;t have mass-market appeal. AT either doesn&#x27;t understand the market, or is understaffed.<p>I get a thorough review can&#x27;t come out on day one, but they need to get something out. Maybe a first look with some opinions, followed by a more thorough review a week later.",
